# Meet Sanju, Designer & Founder

I run [ThisUX](https://thisux.com), a design-led product studio. We make simple, effective products.  

For years, I wore many hats. Now, I focus on building my own ideas.  

Some of my current projects:  

- [Dun](https://dunsuite.com)  
- [Fli](https://fli.so)  
- [Uiino](https://uiino.com)  
- [SticAi](https://sticai.com)  
- [aboGrow](https://abogrow.com)  
- [ffmpeg info](https://ffmpeg.info)  
- [Glance](https://glance.sticai.com)  
- [Spotlight](https://spotlight.thisux.com)  

And more. Always building and tinkering.  

I collaborate with founders and business owners to create MVPs, fix broken designs, and build full-scale products. From design to code, we handle it all.  

The secret? Thoughtful systems that work, no matter the tech or challenge.  

I’m also big on [open source](https://github.com/spikeysanju). I contribute code and speak at conferences.  

Got an idea? [Let’s connect](mailto:work@sanju.sh?subject=Let's%20Collaborate&body=Hi%20Sanju,%0D%0A%0D%0AI%20would%20like%20to%20discuss%20a%20potential%20collaboration%20with%20you.%0D%0A%0D%0ABest%20regards,%0D%0A%5BYour%20Name%5D).
